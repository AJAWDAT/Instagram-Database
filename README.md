Once a user creates an account their information is stored in the 'app_user' table.

A user might follow or be followed by other users, create a post, comment on a post, react to a post or be tagged in a post.

A post that has been created will contain a media file that can be filtered or have effects added.

Other information such as date of the post and the location of the posted media file has also been included.
